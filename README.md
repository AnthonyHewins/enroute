# Why Enroute?

Digital transformation is a key initiative in organizations to [meet business requirements](https://getenroute.io/blog/devops-secops-k8s-cloud-adoption-micro-services/) . This need is driving cloud adoption with a more self-serve DevOps driven approach. Application and micro-services are run in Kubernetes and in public/private cloud with an automated continous delivery pipeline.

As applications undergo this change, traditional API gateways are retrofitted to meet the changing requirements. This has resulted in [multiple API gateways and different solutions](https://getenroute.io/blog/gateway-mesh/) that work only in a subset of use-cases. An API gateway that works for traditional as well as new cloud-native use-cases is critical as an application undergoes this transition.

Enroute is built from ground-up to support both traditional and cloud native use-cases. Enroute can be deployed in [multiple topolgies](https://getenroute.io/blog/enroute-topologies/) to meet the demands of todays application, regardless of where an application is in the cloud journey. The same gateway can be deployed outside kubernetes in [Standalone](https://getenroute.io/docs/getting-started-enroute-standalone-gateway/) mode for traditional use cases, a [kubernetes ingress controller](https://getenroute.io/docs/getting-started-enroute-ingress-controller/) and also inside kubernetes.

Enroute's powerful API brings automation and enables developer operations to treat infrastructure as code. Enroute natively supports [advanced rate-limiting and lua scripting](https://getenroute.io/cookbook/getting-started-advanced-rate-limiting/) as extensible filters or plugins that can be attached either for per-route traffic or all traffic. Enroute API Gateway control plane drives one or many data planes built using [Envoy Proxy](https://envoyproxy.io)
